<h1>The GIFT Block Ciphers</h1>

GIFT is a family of two very lightweight block ciphers: GIFT64 and GIFT128.

The Team responsible for creating the GIFT are: 
Subhadeep Banik, EPFL, Switzerland
Sumit Kumar Pandey, Ashoka University, India
Thomas Peyrin, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore
Yu Sasaki, NTT, Japan
Siang Meng Sim, DSO National Laboratories, Singapore
Yosuke Todo, NTT, Japan

GIFT is used as subcomponent of several NIST lightweight cryptographic competition candidates, notably GIFT-COFB.

You can find test vectors and reference C implementations for both versions of GIFT on the GitHub repository of GIFT.

My intentions with GIFT are to test and work with it to see what it can do!
